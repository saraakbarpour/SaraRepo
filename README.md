# AutomationExercise

#### The automation framework has already taken care of the following:

1. Standing data setup and tear-down have been set up in the feature hooks.
2. Starting/stopping browsers have been setup in the scenario hooks.
3. Taking screenshots have been set up in the scenario step hooks.
4. Customised report generation has been setup up in the test run hooks.
5. Acceptance criteria have been documented in the feature files.
 
#### What you need to do:

1. Fork this repository and implement your solution in your fork.
2. Create or update scenarios if you could identify gaps in acceptance criteria.
3. Create Page Objects to represent pages of the account creation UI.
4. Create and implement step definitions to acutally verify the acceptance criteria documented in feature files.
5. Enhance the framework if you can or raise any ideas of how to improve the automation framework.
6. Share the fork with us, along with a most recently executed html report.
